Rusty Rogue is a simple roguelike game that I am using as a vehicle for learning Rust! I am following the [Hands on Rust](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/) book.

To play this game just clone the repo and `cargo run`

- The dungeon graphics are from [Buch](https://opengameart.org/content/unfinished-dungeon-tileset)

- Potion and scroll graphics are from [Melissa Krautheim](https://opengameart.org/content/fantasy-magic-set)

- Weaponry graphics are from [Melle](https://opengameart.org/content/fantasy-sword-set)

- Monster graphics are from [Chris Hammons](https://github.com/crawl/tiles)
